# Stock-Price-Forcasting-Using-ARIMA-and-R

ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) is a major tool used in time series analysis to attempt to forecast future values of a variable based on its present value. In this project, we will use a stock price time series of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) from 2006-2016, and use the aforementioned model to conduct price forecasting on this time series.
